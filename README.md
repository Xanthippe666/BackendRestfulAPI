### How to use and start
One needs to have the following already installed:
* Node.js
* Npm
* Mysql

Before starting the server, start-up the mysql database. This can be done for example by running the following command in a terminal

`mysqld --console`

Next, clone the github project,

`git clone https://github.com/Xanthippe666/BackendRestfulAPI.git`

Also one needs to build the dependencies for the node.js server. This can be done by typing the following command once inside the main folder,

`npm install`

After downloading all the dependencies, one can then start the node.js server by typing,

`
npm start
`

The server will then start running on localhost through port 2333. If the server fails to connect, the database configuration may be incorrect. Mysql adminâ€˜s username, password, and host settings can be changed in the file named "dbConfig.js" under the folder called "db". Server port settings (default: 2333) can be changed in the file named "index.js" under the main folder

###Testing the API
API testing can be done in postman, curl, advanced Rest client, etc.
